Given a permutation of number from 1 to N. Among all the subarrays, find the number of unique pairs 
(a,b) such that a≠b and a is maximum and b is second maximum in that subarray.

Input:
First line contains an integer, 
(1≤N≤105). Second line contains N space separated distinct integers, 
(1≤Ai≤N), denoting the permutation.

Output:
Print the required answer.
