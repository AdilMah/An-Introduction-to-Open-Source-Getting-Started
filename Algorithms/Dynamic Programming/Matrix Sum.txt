You are given a N * M matrix. You need to print the sum of all the numbers in the rectangle which has (1,1) as the top left corner and (X,Y) as the bottom right corner.

Input:

First line contains two integers, N and M, number of rows and number of columns in the matrix.
Next N lines contains M space separated integers, elements of the matrix.
Next line contains an integer, Q, number of queries.
Each query contains two space separated integers, X and Y.

Output:
For each query, print the sum of all the numbers in the rectangle which has (1,1) as the top left corner and (X,Y) as the bottom right corner.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^3

1≤ elements of matrix ≤10^3

1 ≤ X ≤ N

1 ≤ Y ≤ M

1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5
