You are given a graph containing N vertices and M edges and each edge has an associated weight. The graph contains several Hamiltonian paths that meet all the vertices exactly once. The strength of a Hamiltonian path is defined as the sum of the weight of all the edges in that path.

Write a program to find the minimum element of an array which stores the strength of all the Hamiltonian paths in the graph.

Input format

First line: Two space-separated integers N and M
Next M lines: Three space-separated integers X, Y, and Z (denoting an edge between node X and node Y of weight Z)

Output format

Print the minimum element of an array which stores the strength of all the Hamiltonian paths in the graph.
